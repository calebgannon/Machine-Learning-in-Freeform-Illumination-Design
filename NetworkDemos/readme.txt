This is a simple demo of the neural networks created for the paper Machine Learning in Freeform Illumination Design.

If you do not have LightTools, you will have to stop the code at the indicated line. Or it will just error and stop on its own.

Open the file called 'OffaxisNetDemo (Figs 3,5) Run This', set the desired input parameters (labeled x0 and y0) and run it to create a lens. The lens will automatically be sent to Lighttools for raytracing.

Open the file called 'RectangularNetDemo (Figs 7,8,9) Run This', set the desired input parameters (labeled Lo,Wo and Dtarg) and run it to create a lens. Note the lens was trained of the target half-width, so the inputs should be half what is shown in the paper figures. The lens will automatically be sent to Lighttools for raytracing.
